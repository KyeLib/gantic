# GameplayBehaviorMonitor
A C++ project for analyzing in-game telemetry and detecting player behavior.

## Overview
This project explores how anti-cheat and integrity monitoring systems can detect suspicious behavior by analyzing gameplay data such as input rate, 
movement patterns, and score changes.

This project focuses on the detection logic itself using simulated or recorded data.

## Goals
- Design a C++ system for gameplay data analysis
- Implement detection techniques
- Capable of multithreading
- Add thread id
- Implement a max file size and rotation
- add console output with color coded logs
