# Gameplay-Behavior-Monitor
A C++ project for analyzing in-game telemetry and detecting player behavior.

## Overview
This project explores how anti-cheat and integrity monitoring systems can detect suspicious behavior by analyzing gameplay data such as input rate, 
movement patterns, and score changes.

This project focuses on the detection logic itself using simulated or recorded data.
